# WLAN Auto-Provisioning in Aruba Central
**Date**: November 23, 2025
**Status**: Research Complete - Auto-Provisioning is Automatic

---

## Executive Summary

**TL;DR**: Aruba Central's CNX Config API automatically provisions WLANs to devices. There is NO separate commit or deploy API endpoint needed. Once a WLAN is created and assigned to a scope, it automatically deploys to APs in that scope.

---

## How Auto-Provisioning Works

### The Workflow

1. **Create WLAN** via API:
   ```
   POST /network-config/v1alpha1/wlan-ssids/{name}
   ```
   → WLAN stored in Central's configuration database ✅

2. **Assign to Scope** via API:
   ```
   POST /network-config/v1alpha1/scope-maps/{scopeName}/{persona}/{resource}
   ```
   → WLAN associated with specific site/device-group ✅

3. **Automatic Sync** (No API call needed):
   → Central automatically pushes configuration to APs in that scope ✅
   → APs receive and apply the WLAN configuration ✅

### Timeline

- **Immediate**: Configuration stored in Central database
- **1-5 minutes**: APs check in and receive configuration update
- **Varies**: Depending on AP check-in interval and network conditions

### No Manual Intervention Required

Unlike legacy Aruba controllers that required a "commit" or "deploy" step, **Aruba Central CNX Config API handles provisioning automatically**.

---

## Current WLAN Wizard Implementation

The WLAN wizard already implements the complete workflow:

### Deployment Steps (ReviewDeployPage.jsx)

```javascript
// Step 1: Create Role
POST /api/config/roles/{roleName}

// Step 2: Create WLAN
POST /api/config/wlan/{wlanName}

// Step 3: Assign WLAN to Scope
POST /api/config/scope-maps/{scopeName}/{persona}/wlan-ssids~2F{wlanName}?object_type=LOCAL&scope_id={scopeId}

// Step 4: Assign Role to Scope
POST /api/config/scope-maps/{scopeName}/{persona}/roles~2F{roleName}?object_type=LOCAL&scope_id={scopeId}

// DONE - Configuration automatically syncs to devices
```

**After Step 4 completes successfully, the WLAN will automatically appear on APs** assigned to that scope.

## Research Findings

### 1. No Commit/Deploy Endpoint Found

Extensive search yielded NO separate commit or auto-provision endpoint:

**Endpoints Checked:**
- ❌ `/network-config/v1alpha1/commit` - Does not exist
- ❌ `/network-config/v1alpha1/auto-commit` - Does not exist
- ❌ `/network-config/v1alpha1/provision` - Does not exist
- ❌ `/network-config/v1alpha1/deploy` - Does not exist
- ❌ `/configuration/v1/auto_commit` - Does not exist
- ❌ `/configuration/v1/commit` - Does not exist

**Conclusion**: Auto-provisioning is built into the create/assign workflow.

### 2. Config Checkpoint API (Not Related)

The `/network-config/v1alpha1/config-checkpoint` endpoint exists but is for:
- Creating configuration **snapshots** (backups)
- NOT for committing/deploying configurations to devices

### 3. Industry Documentation

From [Aruba Central documentation](https://developer.arubanetworks.com/central/docs/wlan-configurations):

> "WLAN Configuration workflows are used to create and manage WLANs in a Central UI group - normally WLANs are created manually using Central's UI wizard, but workflows can automate that process using input file configurations instead."

From [Aruba Central NetConductor](https://central.wifidownunder.com/documentation.html):

> "Central Automation Studio provides the ability to assign SSIDs to a selectable list of APs by selecting the config Group, the APs, and then choosing the SSIDs to assign"

**Key Insight**: Configuration assignment (scope-maps) triggers automatic deployment.

## Why "Needs to be Auto Configured"?

### Possible Interpretations:

1. **Verification Needed**
   - User wants to verify WLAN appears on APs after creation
   - Solution: Use verification script (see below)

2. **Timing Concern**
   - User expects instant deployment but there's a 1-5 min sync delay
   - Solution: Documentation explaining expected timeline

3. **Scope Assignment Issue**
   - WLAN created but not assigned to correct scope
   - Solution: Already fixed - wizard assigns to selected site

4. **AP Check-in Delay**
   - APs offline or haven't checked in recently
   - Solution: Wait for next AP check-in cycle

---

## Verification Tools

### Script: verify_wlan_deployment.py

Created verification script to check if WLAN has been deployed to APs:

```bash
python scripts/verify_wlan_deployment.py <wlan_name>
```

**What it checks:**
1. WLAN exists in Central configuration
2. APs are online and accessible
3. WLAN appears in each AP's WLAN list
4. Deployment status per AP

**Example Output:**
```
✓ WLAN 'test-wlan-001' found in Central
✓ Found 5 APs
✓ WLAN is deployed on 5 AP(s)

AUTO-PROVISIONING WORKING! ✓
```

## Best Practices

### For WLAN Creation

1. **Create WLAN** with correct configuration
2. **Assign to Scope** immediately after creation
3. **Wait 1-5 minutes** for automatic provisioning
4. **Verify deployment** using verification script or Central UI

### For Troubleshooting

If WLAN doesn't appear on APs:

1. **Check scope assignment**:
   ```
   GET /network-config/v1alpha1/scope-maps?resource=wlan-ssids/{name}
   ```

2. **Verify AP site membership**:
   ```
   GET /monitoring/v2/aps
   ```
   Check that AP's `site` matches WLAN's scope

3. **Check AP status**:
   - Ensure APs are online (`status: "Up"`)
   - Check last check-in time
   - Verify network connectivity

4. **Wait for sync**:
   - Normal sync interval: 1-5 minutes
   - Force sync: Reboot AP (last resort)

## API Architecture

### CNX Config API Design Philosophy

**Intent-Based Configuration**:
- You declare the **desired state** (WLAN should exist on this site)
- Central automatically **reconciles** actual state to match desired state
- No manual "deploy" or "commit" required

**Scope-Based Deployment**:
- Configurations are scoped to sites, device-groups, or global
- Devices automatically receive configurations for their scope
- Changes propagate automatically when scope membership changes

**Automatic Sync**:
- APs check in regularly (default: every few minutes)
- Central pushes configuration deltas on check-in
- No API call needed to trigger sync

---

## Comparison with Legacy Systems

### Old Aruba Controller (Pre-Central)

```
1. Create WLAN on controller
2. Configure WLAN settings
3. Manual: "write memory" command
4. Manual: Deploy to AP group
5. Manual: Verify deployment
```

### Modern Aruba Central (CNX Config API)

```
1. POST /wlan-ssids/{name}
2. POST /scope-maps (assign to site)
3. ✓ Automatic provisioning to APs
4. ✓ Automatic sync on check-in
```

**Benefit**: Reduced from 5 manual steps to 2 API calls.

## Recommendations

### 1. Update Wizard UI

Add post-deployment notification:

```javascript
// After successful deployment
<Alert severity="success">
  <Typography variant="body2">
    WLAN created successfully!
    Configuration will automatically deploy to APs within 1-5 minutes.
  </Typography>
  <Button onClick={() => verifyDeployment()}>
    Verify Deployment Status
  </Button>
</Alert>
```

### 2. Add Verification Endpoint

Create backend endpoint to check deployment status:

```python
@app.route('/api/config/wlan/<ssid_name>/deployment-status', methods=['GET'])
def get_wlan_deployment_status(ssid_name):
    """Check if WLAN has been deployed to APs"""
    # 1. Get APs in the WLAN's scope
    # 2. Check if WLAN appears on each AP
    # 3. Return deployment percentage
```

### 3. Add Dashboard Widget

Show real-time deployment status:

```
WLAN: test-wlan-001
Status: Deploying... (3/5 APs)
  ✓ AP-Office-1 (Deployed)
  ✓ AP-Office-2 (Deployed)
  ✓ AP-Office-3 (Deployed)
  ⏳ AP-Warehouse-1 (Pending sync)
  ⏳ AP-Warehouse-2 (Pending sync)
```

## Testing the Auto-Provisioning

### Manual Test Procedure

1. **Create test WLAN via wizard**:
   - Name: `test-auto-provision-001`
   - Site: HomeLab
   - SSID: `TestAutoProvision`
   - Auth: WPA2-Personal, password: `Test1234!`

2. **Wait 2 minutes** for sync

3. **Verify in Central UI**:
   - Navigate to Configuration → WLANs
   - Confirm WLAN exists
   - Check "Assigned Sites" shows HomeLab

4. **Check AP deployment**:
   - Navigate to Devices → Access Points
   - Select an AP in HomeLab site
   - Check "WLANs" tab
   - Confirm `TestAutoProvision` SSID appears

5. **Run verification script**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/verify_wlan_deployment.py test-auto-provision-001
   ```

6. **Expected result**:
   ```
   ✓ WLAN 'test-auto-provision-001' found in Central
   ✓ Found 3 APs in HomeLab site
   ✓ WLAN is deployed on 3 AP(s)

   AUTO-PROVISIONING WORKING! ✓
   ```
